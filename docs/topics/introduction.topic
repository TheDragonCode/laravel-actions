        <control>Performing any actions during the deployment process</control>
    </p>
    <p>
        Create specific classes for a one-time or more-time usage, that can be executed automatically after each
        deployment.
        Perfect for seeding or updating some data instantly after some database changes, feature updates, or perform any
        actions.

        This package is for you if...
    </p>
    <list>
        <li>you regularly need to update specific data after you deploy new code</li>
        <li>you often perform jobs after deployment</li>
        <li>you sometimes forget to execute that one specific job and stuff gets crazy</li>
        <li>your code gets cluttered with jobs that are not being used anymore</li>
        <li>your co-workers always need to be reminded to execute that one job after some database changes</li>
        <li>you often seed or process data in a migration file (which is a big no-no!)</li>
    </list>
