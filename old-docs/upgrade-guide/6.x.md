## The easiest way to upgrade

> Note
> If you used inheritance of actions from other actions, then you will need to process these files manually.

For your convenience, we have created an `upgrade` console command:

```bash
composer remove dragon-code/laravel-actions
composer require dragon-code/laravel-deploy-operations:^6.0

php artisan operations:upgrade
php artisan migrate
```

It will do the following:

- Changing the old namespace of “actions” to a new one
- Moves files to a new location
- Updates the configuration file
- Rename the stub file (if published)

Please note that the script allows you to automate most of the actions, but may not complete them completely.
Therefore, you will need to manually check the result of the upgrade by checking this guide.

## Updating Dependencies

You should change the package name in the `composer.json` file from `dragon-code/laravel-actions`
to `dragon-code/laravel-deploy-operations`, and also change its version to `^6.0`:

```json lines
{
    "require": {
        // ...
        "dragon-code/laravel-deploy-operations": "^6.0"
    }
}
```

Then you need to update the dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

## Changed the namespace

The namespace has been changed from `DragonCode\LaravelActions` to `DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations`.

You need to replace it in all actions of your application, as well as when using [events](../helpers/events.md).

## Changed the name of the main class

You should replace `DragonCode\LaravelActions\Action` namespace with `DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\Operation`.

## Changed names of console commands

| New Name              | Old Name           |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `make:operation`      | `make:action`      |
| `operations`          | `actions`          |
| `operations:fresh`    | `actions:fresh`    |
| `operations:install`  | `actions:install`  |
| `operations:refresh`  | `actions:refresh`  |
| `operations:reset`    | `actions:reset`    |
| `operations:rollback` | `actions:rollback` |
| `operations:status`   | `actions:status`   |
| `operations:stub`     | `actions:stub`     |
| `operations:upgrade`  | `actions:upgrade`  |

## Changed event names

| New Name                    | Old Name           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| `DeployOperationStarted`    | `ActionStarted`    |
| `DeployOperationEnded`      | `ActionEnded`      |
| `DeployOperationFailed`     | `ActionFailed`     |
| `NoPendingDeployOperations` | `NoPendingActions` |

Don't forget to also change the namespace from `DragonCode\LaravelActions\Events`
to `DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\Events`.

## Changed property typing for events

The type of the `method` property for events has been changed.

Before:

```php
use DragonCode\LaravelActions\Events\ActionEnded;
use DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\Enums\MethodEnum;

/** @var ActionEnded */
$event->method; // is string
```

After:

```php
use DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\Enums\MethodEnum;
use DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\Events\DeployOperationEnded;

/** @var DeployOperationEnded */
$event->method; // is MethodEnum
```

## Configuration file name changed

We recommend that you delete the old configuration file `config/actions.php` and publish a new one.
This way you will see the changes made to it.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\ServiceProvider"
```

## Changed names of constants

If you use package constant references, you must also rename them.

The old name was in `UPPER_CASE`, the new one was in `PascalCase`.

For example:

```php
// Old
class Names
{
    public const ACTIONS = 'actions';
    public const FRESH = 'actions:fresh';
    // ...
}
```

```php
// New
class Names
{
    public const Operations = 'operations';
    public const Fresh = 'operations:fresh';
    // ...
}
```

## Changed directory location

File storage directory changed to `operations` from `actions`.

## Database transactions

The following properties have been removed:

- `$transactions`
- `$transactionAttempts`

Instead, you can use the `hasTransactions` and `transactionAttempts` methods.

The `enabledTransactions` method has been renamed to `hasTransactions`.

## Removed `$async` property

The `$async` property has been removed from the base class.
You can use the previously available `isAsync` method instead.

## Stub name changed

If you published a stub file, then you also need to rename it from `stubs/action.stub` to `stubs/deploy-operation.stub`
and make changes to its structure. 

## Removed `operations:stub` command

The `php artisan operations:stub` console command has been removed. Use another command instead:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=stubs --provider="DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\ServiceProvider"
```
