- [Action storage directory changed](#actions-location)

## The easiest way to upgrade

> Note
> If you used inheritance of actions from other actions, then you will need to process these files manually.

For your convenience, we have created an upgrade console command:

```bash
composer require dragon-code/laravel-migration-actions:^3.0
php artisan migrate:actions:upgrade
php artisan migrate
```

It will do the following:

- Change the namespace of the abstract class
- Add a strict type declaration
- Replace the `up` method with `__invoke` if the class does not have a `down` method
- Replace named classes with anonymous ones
- Create a configuration file according to the data saved in your project
- Changes properties from `snake_case` to `camelCase`

## Updating Dependencies

### PHP 8.0.2 Required

Deploy Actions for Laravel now requires PHP 8.0.2 or greater.

### Composer Dependencies

You should update the following dependency in your application's `composer.json` file:

- `dragon-code/laravel-migration-actions` to `^3.0`

## Configuration

Publish the config file and migrate the settings from the `config/database.php` file to `config/actions.php`.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DragonCode\LaravelActions\ServiceProvider"
```

## Actions Location

Move the action files to the `actions` folder in the project root, or update the `actions.path` option in the
configuration file.

## Parent Namespace

Replace `DragonCode\LaravelActions\Support\Actionable` with `DragonCode\LaravelActions\Action`.

## Anonymous Classes

Replace named calls to your application's classes with anonymous ones.

For example:

```php
// before
use DragonCode\LaravelActions\Support\Actionable;

class Some extends Actionable {}

// after
use DragonCode\LaravelActions\Action;

return new class extends Action {};
```

## Invokable Method

If your class does not contain a `down` method, then you can replace the `up` method with `__invoke`.

## Changed Action Repository

Just call the `php artisan migrate` command to make changes to the action repository table.

## Changed Properties

Make sure all overridden properties are typed:

| Old Name                        | New Name                                         |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| protected $once                 | protected bool $once                             |
| protected $transactions         | protected bool $transactions                     |
| protected $transaction_attempts | protected int $transactionAttempts               |
| protected $environment          | protected string\|array\|null $environment       |
| protected $except_environment   | protected string\|array\|null $exceptEnvironment |
| protected $before               | protected bool $before                           |

## Added recursive search for actions in a folder

### Before:

```bash
2022_10_13_013321_test1
2022_10_13_013326_test2
bar/2022_10_13_013323_test3 # will not be called
```

### After:

```bash
2022_10_13_013321_test1
2022_10_13_013326_test2
bar/2022_10_13_013323_test3 # will be called
